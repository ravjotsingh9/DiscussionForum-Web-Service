## Discussion Forum Web Service
It is a simple web service to support posting a comment in a forum and getting comments back.

#### Running
Use `dep ensure` to download all the dependecies. Note: you need to set up go env.
Then use `docker-compose up -d --build` to run the web-service and the postgres databse.
